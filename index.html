                    If you’re a beginner to code and just started learning HTML and CSS, you may be wondering what HTML
                    and
                    CSS projects you can do to <a class="common-link" href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp"
                        target="_blank">build
                        your portfolio</a>
                    and hone your
                    skills. You might even ask whether or not you can actually do anything with just HTML and CSS
                    knowledge!
                    The good news is that there are many types of HTML and CSS projects out there that beginners can use
                    to
                    practice coding, build up skills, keep learning, level up your knowledge, and <a class="common-link"
                        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank">even start earning money.</a>

                    The first website I built — the final project of a video lesson series on an online learning
                    platform — was made purely with HTML and CSS. Even though it was a basic static web page for a fake
                    bakery that would never be seen or hosted anywhere, I was thrilled. I had created something that
                    wasn’t there before, using code. As an English major, using language in this tangible way was new to
                    me, and HTML and CSS made it possible. The experience motivated me to continue learning — I’m still
                    learning today, even after years of working as a software engineer.
